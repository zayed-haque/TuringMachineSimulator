# TuringMachineSimulator

Develop and accurately implement a set of transition rules that dictate how the machine reads and writes on the tape, moves the tape head, and transitions between different states based on the input string.

Establish clear criteria for when the Turing machine should accept an input string (indicating conformity to the predefined rules) or reject it (indicating non-conformity), including conditions for reaching specific accepting or rejecting states.

Design a mechanism for the machine to halt operation under appropriate conditions, such as when it enters a state with no applicable transition rules, to prevent it from entering infinite loops and to ensure efficient computation.
